# 100 Days Of Code - Log
#### # of missed days to make up for: 4

### Day 0: February 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Answered a couple of leetcode problems using c++.

**Thoughts:** 
- FizzBuzz:
I initially was really frustrated since I knew how to answer the problem, I just needed to figure out the correct syntax. It took a lot out of me to not switch to a different language, but I pushed myself to finish the exercise in c++.
- Teemo Attacking: This problem was actually not too hard, what took me the most time was to actually understand the problem in the first place. Once I had a clear idea of what solution was needed, it was easier to figure out what to do next.

### Day 2: February 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Answered a couple of leetcode problems using c++, have a better understanding of the binary search :D .

**Thoughts:** 
- Guess Number Higher or Lower: I new that using a binary search would be very helpful, I spent a while trying to figure out how to implement it in code and forced myself to not look up an example. Which I was able to do! I mean the code is a bit more lengthy compared to the solution, but I'm happy I was able to at least implement a version of the algorithm.

- First Bad Version: I felt a lot more confident coming into this problem, and had an idea of how to better implement the binary search. It took a bit for my head to wrap around the problem, it wasn't until I sat back and actually spoke and visualized the process, was I able to find what errors I was making.

### Day 3: February 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a snake game project using OpenGL.

**Thoughts:**
- Snake Game: I mostly worked on setting up the shader program, VBO, VAO and EBO classes, which I am slowly getting accustomed to. There seems to be some issues with my code, and will need to go back and figure out why the vertex shader and fragment shader aren't compiling.

### Day 5:February 14th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a snake game project using OpenGL and a leetcode problem.
- Snake Game: I was able to fix a couple of issues with compiling the shaders :D I just had add another call to linking attributes from the VAO in order to take into consideration the color component of the triangles, and I had a missing semicolon with the fragment shader.
- Add Two Numbers: I worked on a leetcode problem for a couple of hours. It's related to recursion, and at first it seemed pretty straight forward, but I need to take a closer look to creating linked lists in C++ in order to be able to solve it.

### Day 6:February 15th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a snake game project using OpenGL and a leetcode problem, again.
- Snake Game: So for today, I just focused on refactoring some of the code of the project, more specifically the reading from files. I added a function to read the glsl shaders, I had some issues which actually turned out to be a typo from writing the extension of the vertex shader. Had `.vect` instead of `.vert`
- Add Two Numbers: I thought I could finish this today, but alas, I did not. I was able to make a lot more progress compared to yesterday, which I am pretty proud of. I have a better understanding of linked lists in C++ now. They are a bit tedious to deal with :').

### Day 7:February 16th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Solved a leetcode problem and worked on adding moving to my snake game.
- Snake Game: I was able to add a function to process the user input to control the movement of the snake. It starts moving automatically, and the program exits once the snake reaches one of the screen edges.
- Add Two Numbers: I was able to finish this problem using recursion, and by finding a way to indicate the program when there is an extra 1 to be added to the next node.

### Day 8:February 18th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: First day at Hackathon with Pearl Hacks.
- Making a tetris like game: Downloaded Godot, and struggled with setting up the correct compiler for the engine. I was able to get it fixed after a couple of hours. I started the main project and created some block objects to be used in the game. Learned a lot about C# in Godot.

### Day 9:February 19th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Second day at Hackathon with Pearl Hacks.
- Making a tetris like drawing game: Made final changes with the project, in order to have a good prototype for presenting the final project. Implemented a couple of ideas, which were then tweaked by my team member in order to get a more smoother game play. Was pretty satisfied with the final project result.

### Day 10:February 21th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Snake Game, added collision with apple mechanism.
-Snake Game with OpenGL: I was able to figure out a way to check for collisions between the snake head and the apple. It's not perfect, and still has some issues, but it's a good start! With this I can move forward with figuring out how to render the growth of the snake.
