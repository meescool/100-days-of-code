# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Answered a couple of leetcode problems using c++.

**Thoughts:** 
- FizzBuzz:
I initially was really frustrated since I knew how to answer the problem, I just needed to figure out the correct syntax. It took a lot out of me to not switch to a different language, but I pushed myself to finish the exercise in c++.
- Teemo Attacking: This problem was actually not too hard, what took me the most time was to actually understand the problem in the first place. Once I had a clear idea of what solution was needed, it was easier to figure out what to do next.

### Day 2: February 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Answered a couple of leetcode problems using c++, have a better understanding of the binary search :D .

**Thoughts:** 
- Guess Number Higher or Lower: I new that using a binary search would be very helpful, I spent a while trying to figure out how to implement it in code and forced myself to not look up an example. Which I was able to do! I mean the code is a bit more lengthy compared to the solution, but I'm happy I was able to at least implement a version of the algorithm.

- First Bad Version: I felt a lot more confident coming into this problem, and had an idea of how to better implement the binary search. It took a bit for my head to wrap around the problem, it wasn't until I sat back and actually spoke and visualized the process, was I able to find what errors I was making.

### Day 3: February 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a snake game project using OpenGL.

**Thoughts:** 
-Snake Game: I mostly worked on setting up the shader program, VBO, VAO and EBO classes, which I am slowly getting accustomed to. There seems to be some issues with my code, and will need to go back and figure out why the vertex shader and fragment shader aren't compiling.
