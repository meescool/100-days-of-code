# 100 Days Of Code - Log
#### # of missed days to make up for: 12 ... so technically 112 days of code ðŸ˜œ

### Day 0: February 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Answered a couple of leetcode problems using c++.

**Thoughts:** 
- FizzBuzz:
I initially was really frustrated since I knew how to answer the problem, I just needed to figure out the correct syntax. It took a lot out of me to not switch to a different language, but I pushed myself to finish the exercise in c++.
- Teemo Attacking: This problem was actually not too hard, what took me the most time was to actually understand the problem in the first place. Once I had a clear idea of what solution was needed, it was easier to figure out what to do next.

### Day 2: February 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Answered a couple of leetcode problems using c++, have a better understanding of the binary search :D .

**Thoughts:** 
- Guess Number Higher or Lower: I new that using a binary search would be very helpful, I spent a while trying to figure out how to implement it in code and forced myself to not look up an example. Which I was able to do! I mean the code is a bit more lengthy compared to the solution, but I'm happy I was able to at least implement a version of the algorithm.

- First Bad Version: I felt a lot more confident coming into this problem, and had an idea of how to better implement the binary search. It took a bit for my head to wrap around the problem, it wasn't until I sat back and actually spoke and visualized the process, was I able to find what errors I was making.

### Day 3: February 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a snake game project using OpenGL.

**Thoughts:**
- Snake Game: I mostly worked on setting up the shader program, VBO, VAO and EBO classes, which I am slowly getting accustomed to. There seems to be some issues with my code, and will need to go back and figure out why the vertex shader and fragment shader aren't compiling.

### Day 5:February 14th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a snake game project using OpenGL and a leetcode problem.
- Snake Game: I was able to fix a couple of issues with compiling the shaders :D I just had add another call to linking attributes from the VAO in order to take into consideration the color component of the triangles, and I had a missing semicolon with the fragment shader.
- Add Two Numbers: I worked on a leetcode problem for a couple of hours. It's related to recursion, and at first it seemed pretty straight forward, but I need to take a closer look to creating linked lists in C++ in order to be able to solve it.

### Day 6:February 15th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a snake game project using OpenGL and a leetcode problem, again.
- Snake Game: So for today, I just focused on refactoring some of the code of the project, more specifically the reading from files. I added a function to read the glsl shaders, I had some issues which actually turned out to be a typo from writing the extension of the vertex shader. Had `.vect` instead of `.vert`
- Add Two Numbers: I thought I could finish this today, but alas, I did not. I was able to make a lot more progress compared to yesterday, which I am pretty proud of. I have a better understanding of linked lists in C++ now. They are a bit tedious to deal with :').

### Day 7:February 16th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Solved a leetcode problem and worked on adding moving to my snake game.
- Snake Game: I was able to add a function to process the user input to control the movement of the snake. It starts moving automatically, and the program exits once the snake reaches one of the screen edges.
- Add Two Numbers: I was able to finish this problem using recursion, and by finding a way to indicate the program when there is an extra 1 to be added to the next node.

### Day 8:February 18th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: First day at Hackathon with Pearl Hacks.
- Making a tetris like game: Downloaded Godot, and struggled with setting up the correct compiler for the engine. I was able to get it fixed after a couple of hours. I started the main project and created some block objects to be used in the game. Learned a lot about C# in Godot.

### Day 9:February 19th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Second day at Hackathon with Pearl Hacks.
- Making a tetris like drawing game: Made final changes with the project, in order to have a good prototype for presenting the final project. Implemented a couple of ideas, which were then tweaked by my team member in order to get a more smoother game play. Was pretty satisfied with the final project result.

### Day 10:February 21th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Snake Game, added collision with apple mechanism.
- Snake Game with OpenGL: I was able to figure out a way to check for collisions between the snake head and the apple. It's not perfect, and still has some issues, but it's a good start! With this I can move forward with figuring out how to render the growth of the snake.

### Day 11:February 22th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Snake Game, added texturing for the apple.
- Snake Game with OpenGL: Today I just worked on adding the texture for the apple, there are some issues with the background not being transparent so I'll have to go back and fix the issue. I am thinking of making it it's own class, in order to facilitate the texture for the snake and maybe a bacground texture too.

### Day 12:February 23th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Snake Game, added a texture class.
- Snake Game with OpenGL: I decided it would be best to make a class just for textures. So I refactored my code to do that :)

### Day 13:February 28th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Tic Tac Toe PG project.
- Tic Tac Toe PG: I decided to take a small break from my Snake game and decided to work on my Tic Tac Toe game, that also includes a GUI using the Pygame module from python. It took me a while to get reaquainted with the code. Thankfully I was actually able to make some significant process by adding the ability to for the player to add their marks and the CPU adds marks randomly.

### Day 14: March 1st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Tic Tac Toe PG project.
- Tic Tac Toe PG: Today I worked on mostly finding ways to display the right marks on the grid, and having the program wait a couple seconds before putting down the cpu's mark in order to simulate as if it were thinking. I have put off this project for a while, and since I have done some studying and practicing during that time, I found it a lot easier to dive in :)

### Day 15: March 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Tic Tac Toe PG project.
- Tic Tac Toe PG: Today I implemented a checking function for my tic tac toe game. It checks if the user or cpu has three marks in a row or in a column. It shows a `You Won!` or `You Lost` or `Draw!` message on a separate screen. I was quite happy that the answer I implemented didn't take me as long as I thought it would since I went over some of the algorthims as a possible answer.

### Day 16: March 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Tic Tac Toe PG project.
- Tic Tac Toe PG: Today I added the diagonal checking to my check answer function, thus fixing the issue where it only counted as a win if rows or columns had three marks. It was not as hard as I thought it would've been to implement it, though of course I would still like to see if it can be improved further

### Day 17: March 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I attended the cmd=f 2022 Hackathon and started my Easel Share project.
- Easel Share: I came up with the idea of creating an online learning platform for artists! I was able to get a basic design and website prototype started.

### Day 18: March 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I attended the cmd=f 2022 Hackathon and worked on my Easel Share project.
- Easel Share: I worked some more on my prototype and was able to get the canvas to work at a decent degree. It is still very rough, but I do look forward to working  more on it. I think I will need to focus on finishing the design and planning out the website better. As for code, I will definitely spend a lot of time perfecting the canvas element :)

### Day 19: March 8th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added my demo reel to my website.
- My website: For the past couple of days I was working on creating my demo reel, I then worked on adding it to my website in the blog section.

### Day 20: March 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Updated my website.
- My website: I decided to add its own little section for the demo reel and worked on updating and modifying the website. I'm really excited about how it's all tying up together, and I'm starting to see how my skills are starting to come together :D

### Day 21: March 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Update my Tic Tac Toe PG game and start a new opengl project
- Tic Tac Toe PG: Added two more sprites that the player can choose to play as in the game. I also modified the code so that it will go through the extra options, will need to make some changes in the future so that I don't have to modify the code and it that updates automatically.
- Flashing Colors Cubes: Started an opengl project to practice with 3D graphice programming. Used my previous project flashingColorsGrid as a boiler template since it already has the shader and buffer classes defined.
